Description:

I made this project to illustrate the abundance of stress that some people face in today's world. The large word 'stress' represents the main concept, and the several words surrounding it are all the things that potentially add to this stressful lifestyle. I included all of these words to visually represent how stress can often be caused when many problems compound.

Ultimately I intend for this piece to make viewers consider all of the things that fill their daily lives with stress, and consider how much they actually should be pursuing these things.
