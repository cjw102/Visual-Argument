Description:

I made this project to illustrate the abundance of stress that some people face in today's world. The large word 'stress' in the center represents the main concept, and the several words surrounding it are all the things that potentially add to this stressful lifestyle. I included all of these words to visually represent how stress can often be caused when many problems compound.
